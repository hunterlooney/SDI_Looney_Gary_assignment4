//String
//1)Does a string follow a 123-456-7890 pattern like a 
//  phone number?

//2)Does a string follow an aaa@bbb.ccc pattern like 
//  an email address?

//3)Is the string a URL? (Does it start with http: or 
//  https:?)

//4)Title-case a string (split into words, then 
//  uppercase the first letter of each word)

//5)Given a string that is a list of things separated 
//  by a given string, as well as another string separator,
//  return a string with the first separator changed to 
//  the second: "a,b,c" + "," + "/" → "a/b/c".


//Number
//1)Format a number to use a specific number of decimal 
//places, as for money: 2.1 → 2.10

//2)Fuzzy-match a number: is the number above or below a 
//number within a certain percent?

//3)Find the number of hours or days difference between 
//two dates.

//4)Given a string version of a number such as "42", 
//return the value as an actual Number, such as 42.


//Array
//1)Find the smallest value in an array that is greater 
//than a given number

//2)Find the total value of just the numbers in an array, 
//even if some of the items are not numbers.

//3)Given an array of objects and the name of a key, 
//return the array sorted by the value of that key 
//in each of the objects: 
//"a" + [{a:2},{a:3},{a:1}] → [{a:1},{a:2},{a:3}].



//Make-up
/*
// You may use this assignment to make up some of what you 
// lost on points for the first three assignments:

// Implement all twelve functions above. At least ten of 
// them should work correctly, but any that do not work 
// should at least have a solid effort in them. If you 
// don't get at least this far, none of the rest of this 
// list applies.

// Comment the sections of your code that show that you 
// know how to do whatever you lost points for on a 
// previous assignment. If you don't have an explicit 
// comment you won't get credit. For example, if you lost 
// points for not including a nested loop in 
// Deliverable 3, include a comment that says something 
// like:
// 1
// MAKEUP: nested loops, deliverable 3
// For each fixed instance you may earn up to ¾ or 75% 
// of the points you lost for that item. So if you lost 
// 8 points for an item on the previous assignment, you 
// can get 6 of them back.
// Your fixed code must work! There is no partial credit 
// per item. In the above example, it's 6 points or nothing.
// Yes, it's going to be a whole lot of work to get the 
// points back. But it's an opportunity to make up 75% of 
// what you lost.
